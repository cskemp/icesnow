allcounts.txt contains statistics for the tweets in our data set (which is
not included here).

The format is:

ISO 639-1 language code, snow form count, ice form count, token count (ie
total number of tokens across all tweets in this language), tweet count
(ie total number of tweets in this language)

We take the 42 languages with the most tokens -- see allcodes.txt and
longnames.txt. We then 

- drop Latin (not current), Experanto (artificial), Breton + Aragonese (no
  Google translate)
- drop languages without spaces between words: Japanese, Thai, Chinese

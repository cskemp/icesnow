Data files specifying which languages merge (ie use the same term for)
ice/snow and other pairs

IDS+ data
=========

idspluscolex.mat: information about which languages in IDS+ merge which
concepts.

editd(i,j) is 1 if language i uses the same term for the concepts in pair
j, and 0 if the language uses different terms. NaN is used for cases where
terms for one or both concepts are missing from the wordlist for that
language. 

isocodes contains ISO language codes for the 323 languages in the data
set.

lpairs(i,:) contains indices for the concepts in pair i. The indices are
with respect to the list of 1310 concepts in ids_keys.

langmat(i,j) is 1 if the wordlist for language i includes a term for
concept j.

idspluscolex.mat was created using wordlists downloaded from IDS and WOLD
These wordlists and the code used to process them are not included in this
release, because the IDS license suggests that derivatives may not be
distributed.

Dictionary data
===============

librarydata.csv: the original file summarizing the results of the library
survey. Includes information about words for arm/hand -- these data are
not discussed in the paper.

dictiscolex.mat: information about which languages in the dictionary data
set merge which concepts.

Twitter data
=============

twittercolex.mat: a file that includes glottocodes for the languages in
the full twitter data set (and no colexification data).
